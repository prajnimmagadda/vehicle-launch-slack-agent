# ðŸ”’ Security Fixes Required Before Production Deployment

## Critical Security Issues to Address

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location:** `databricks_client.py`
**Issues:** 5 potential SQL injection vectors
**Fix:** Use parameterized queries instead of string formatting

```python
# BEFORE (Vulnerable)
query = f"SELECT * FROM {table} WHERE date = '{date}'"

# AFTER (Secure)
query = "SELECT * FROM {} WHERE date = %s".format(table)
params = [date]
```

### 2. Dependency Vulnerabilities (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issues:** Outdated packages with known vulnerabilities
**Fix:** Update requirements_production.txt

```bash
# Update vulnerable packages
pip install --upgrade jinja2 pillow cryptography urllib3
```

### 3. Request Timeouts (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Location:** `file_parser.py`
**Issue:** Missing timeout in HTTP requests
**Fix:** Add timeout parameters

```python
# Add timeout to all requests
response = requests.get(url, timeout=30)
```

### 4. Network Binding (LOW PRIORITY)
**Location:** `monitoring.py`
**Issue:** Potential binding to all interfaces
**Fix:** Bind to specific interface

```python
# Bind to localhost only
app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=9090)
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1 (1-2 days): Critical Security
- [ ] Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Update vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Add request timeouts

### Phase 2 (3-5 days): Code Quality
- [ ] Fix type checking errors
- [ ] Improve test coverage
- [ ] Address linting issues

### Phase 3 (1 week): Production Hardening
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement proper logging
- [ ] Add monitoring alerts

## Deployment Checklist
