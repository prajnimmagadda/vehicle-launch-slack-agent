## Test Strategy

### 1. Mocking Strategy
- Used `unittest.mock` for external dependencies
- Avoided complex external service calls
- Focused on testing business logic rather than integration points

### 2. Error Handling
- Comprehensive testing of exception scenarios
- Validation of error messages and fallback behavior
- Testing of edge cases and boundary conditions

### 3. Integration Testing
- Database and monitoring integration
- File parser and OpenAI integration
- Databricks and OpenAI integration
- End-to-end workflow testing

## Areas for Future Improvement

### 1. High Priority (Target 80%+)
- **google_sheets_dashboard.py**: Needs comprehensive Google Sheets API testing
- **production_slack_bot.py**: Requires Slack API integration testing
- **slack_bot.py**: Needs Slack event handling testing

### 2. Medium Priority
- **start_bot.py**: Application startup and configuration testing
- **run_tests.py**: Test runner functionality testing

### 3. Low Priority
- **run_tests.py**: Utility script, lower priority for coverage

## Recommendations for 80% Coverage

### 1. Google Sheets Dashboard
- Add comprehensive mocking for Google Sheets API
- Test dashboard creation, updating, and formatting
- Test error handling for API failures

### 2. Slack Bot Components
- Mock Slack API responses
- Test event handling and message processing
- Test bot initialization and startup

### 3. Start Bot
- Test environment validation
- Test application startup sequence
- Test error handling during startup
